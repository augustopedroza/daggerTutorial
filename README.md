# Dagger Tutorial in Kotlin

A new [dagger tutorial](https://dagger.dev/tutorial/) has been release and it does a great job at presenting many of the dagger capabilities. Since the sample code is in java and only presents the final solution. I decided to put together a kotlin version and also made sure each brach represents a page in the tutorial.

Recommended branch order follows the same title of the tutorial pages:
1. InitialDaggerSetup
2. AddingOurFirstCommand
3. DependingOnAnInterface
4. AnAbstractionForOutput
5. ANewCommand
6. TwoCommandsForThePriceOfOne
7. User-SpecificTypes
8. MaintainingState
9. OnlyAllowDepositingAfterLoggingIn
10. AddingAWithdrawCommand
11. LoggingOut
12. EnforcingTheMaximumWithdrawlAcrossCommands
13. AvoidingRecursiveLogins

No optimizations have been made to this code. This is fruit of pesonal study session.
